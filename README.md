# Getting Started

This service is a simple example of a REST API that uses Redis as a storage.
The service has a post endpoint to store a simple entity with a string value.
The service has a get endpoint to retrieve the entity by the id.

The architecture of the service is based on a simple **hexagonal architecture**, where the service is divided into layers:
- **Domain**: Layer responsible for the entities of the service.
- **Application**: Layer responsible for the business rules of the service.
- **Infrastructure**: Layer responsible for the external dependencies of the service.
